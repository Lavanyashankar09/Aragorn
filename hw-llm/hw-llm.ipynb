That will produce much more output.

The Llama bindings also allow you to [constrain the output by an arbitrary CFG](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md), using `grammar=...`.  This is useful if you're generating code or data that must be syntactically valid to be useful to you.

    "User Input: \"(lavanya) hi akiki\"\n",
    "- Akiki's Response: \"These were the acts of corrupt local government, and the Chinese Communist Party's top disciplinary exonerated the doctor and criticized local officials.\"\n",
    "- Akiki provides a detailed and relevant response, linking the user's greeting to the corrupt acts of the local government and the response from the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
    "- Akiki successfully incorporates context from the Kialo claim to maintain relevance.\n",

    "User Input: \"(lavanya) meat\"\n",
    "- Akiki's Response: \"It is more ethical to give to charity than to not give to charity, but to not give to charity is not immoral.\"\n",
    "- Akiki's response appears to be unrelated to the user's query about meat. This may be a case where the BM25 query did not capture the context appropriately, resulting in an off-topic response.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: \"(lavanya) calories is\"\n",
    "- Akiki's Response: \"We measure those conversation ratios by burning the material in question and measuring the heat outputs. This is not a good analog for how our body processes those materials...\"\n",
    "- Akiki delivers a comprehensive and detailed response to the user's inquiry about calories. It demonstrates the bot's ability to handle complex topics and provide informative answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Akiko's Conversations:\n",
    "User Input: \"(lavanya) tell me about meat\"\n",
    "- Akiko's Response: \"If many non-meat eaters are living in a place it can be assumed that it is easier than if fewer non-meat eaters live in that place.\"\n",
    "- Akiko's response is relevant to the user's question, providing information about the circumstances of non-meat eaters. It maintains relevance to the Kialo claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: \"(lavanya) what about calories\"\n",
    "- Akiko's Response: \"39% of Americans thought the US was on the 'right track' in 2018.\"\n",
    "- Akiko's response seems off-topic, providing unrelated information about Americans' perception of the country's direction. This may be a case where the BM25 query did not capture the context appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Assessment:\n",
    "- Akiki generally performs well in providing detailed and relevant responses, especially in handling long turns and complex topics.\n",
    "- Both Akiki and Akiko show instances where the BM25 query may not capture the context appropriately, leading to off-topic responses in short turns.\n",
    "- Akiki's ability to include and weight more recent turns contributes to its improved performance in addressing short turns.\n"

    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [here](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"
